	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>
		The task of sarcasm classification is important because it can help
		filter misinformation online, and can also assist with other machine
		learning tasks such as sentiment analysis. My team reimplemented a
		<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13008" class="link"
			>scientific paper</a
		>
		that focused on implementing sarcasm detection <i>without</i> the use of
		graph structures - which are extremely computationally expensive to
		create. The model in the paper instead aims to understand dynamic
		relationships between image and text to learn the context of sarcasm.
