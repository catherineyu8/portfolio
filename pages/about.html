			i love all sorts of arts and crafts (crocheting, origami, collaging;
			i've tried it all), and learning to cook traditional Chinese dishes
			from my mom! in my free time i try to spend time outdoors soaking up
			as much of the Seattle sun as i can. catch me exploring local coffee
			shops and walking around the city, taking photos of anything and
			everything. i am also an avid Notion and GCal user/enthusiast. the
			more organized my planner, the more organized my life :D
