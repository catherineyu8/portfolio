					Hi, I'm Catherine! I'm a full-stack developer based in
					Seattle, currently at Brown University studying computer
					science
					<!-- and applied math (?) -->. At Brown, I am a member of
					the Women's Varsity Swim and Dive Team, an undergraduate TA
					for CSCI 0170 (one of Brown's intro CS courses), and the
					Events chair of Girls Who Code.

				I love to spend time in the kitchen making coffee and matcha at
				my home cafe, learning to cook traditional Chinese dishes from
				my mom, and baking elaborate desserts. I also enjoy getting
				crafty - some favorite art forms are been origami, collaging,
				and crocheting - but I'm open to try anything! When I'm free, I
				like to get outdoors and soak up as much of the Seattle sun as I
				can. Catch me exploring local coffee shops and restaurants,
				thrifting, and hiking in the nearby mountains!

				<!-- i am also an avid Notion and GCal
				user/enthusiast. the more organized my planner, the more
				organized my life :D -->
